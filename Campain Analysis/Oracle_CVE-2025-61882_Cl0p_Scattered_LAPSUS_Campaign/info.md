Subject: URGENT: Oracle CVE-2025-61882 Critical RCE Vulnerability - Active Exploitation by Cl0p & Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters

Dear Team,

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED** - Oracle has issued a critical security alert for CVE-2025-61882, a zero-day vulnerability in Oracle E-Business Suite that is being actively exploited by sophisticated threat actors. This vulnerability allows remote code execution without authentication, making it extremely dangerous and requiring immediate attention.

**The Threat Landscape:**
Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) systems are under active attack by two notorious threat groups: the Cl0p ransomware group and Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters (Scattered Spider). These actors have developed and deployed exploit tools specifically targeting this vulnerability, leading to confirmed data theft attacks across multiple organizations. The severity of this situation prompted Oracle to rush-release a patch, bypassing their normal quarterly update cycle.

**Technical Impact:**
CVE-2025-61882 represents a critical security flaw that enables remote code execution without any authentication requirements. This means attackers can exploit the vulnerability directly over the network without needing valid credentials, making it particularly attractive to threat actors. The vulnerability affects Oracle E-Business Suite systems and, if successfully exploited, grants attackers complete control over the affected systems.

**Our Threat Intelligence Response:**
Our threat intelligence team has been tracking this campaign and has developed comprehensive analysis materials. We have identified specific indicators of compromise (IOCs) including command and control infrastructure, exploit tools, and attack patterns. Our analysis reveals the sophisticated nature of this campaign, with threat actors using custom Python-based exploit tools and establishing reverse shell connections for persistent access.

**Detection and Mitigation:**
We have created a complete threat intelligence package including detailed IOC lists, MISP event data for threat intelligence sharing, comprehensive campaign analysis, and custom Sigma detection rules. Our detection capabilities cover network-level monitoring for C2 communications, endpoint detection for exploit tool execution, and application-level monitoring for Oracle EBS exploitation attempts.

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **Asset inventory check** - Please verify if our organization has any Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) systems in our environment
2. **Critical alert handling** - Even if we don't have Oracle EBS systems, this must be treated as a critical alert since Cl0p is on our threat radar and may use similar techniques against our infrastructure
3. **Patch immediately** - If Oracle EBS systems are present, apply Oracle's security update for CVE-2025-61882
4. **Prerequisite check** - Ensure October 2023 Critical Patch Update is installed first
5. **Network monitoring** - Deploy our detection rules to identify potential exploitation attempts
6. **System assessment** - Review Oracle EBS systems for signs of compromise
7. **Threat hunting** - Use our provided IOCs to search for historical exploitation attempts

**Business Impact:**
The combination of zero-day exploitation, no authentication requirements, and involvement of financially motivated threat groups creates a perfect storm for significant business disruption. Organizations using Oracle EBS for critical business processes face immediate risk of data theft, system compromise, and potential ransomware deployment.

This security alert validates our threat intelligence analysis and confirms the critical nature of this vulnerability. The active exploitation by sophisticated threat actors, combined with the zero-day nature of this vulnerability, makes immediate action essential to protect our infrastructure and data assets.

Please prioritize this security update and coordinate with your security teams to implement the necessary protective measures immediately.

Best regards,
ThreatOps Team
